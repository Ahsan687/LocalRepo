## Languages and Technologies

Currently, this repository contains programs written in the following languages and technologies:

- Python
- C-lang.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each language or technology. Inside each folder, you'll find programs on different topics which correspond the code files.

Feel free to navigate through the  files to explore the topics I've been learning.

## How to Use

If you're interested in exploring any particular topic or project:

1. Navigate to the respective language/technology folder.
2. Choose the topic or project you're interested in.
3. Open the corresponding code file(s) to view the code.
4. Feel free to experiment with the code, make modifications, or use it as a reference for your own projects.
